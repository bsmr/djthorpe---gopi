# Hardware

This section describes how to use the hardware features of the Raspberry Pi,
including the General Purpose ([GPIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output))
connector, [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface)
and [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) busses.

## Overview

These are the units you can embed into your application:

  * `gopi.Platform` Return information about the hardware platform;
  * `gopi.DisplayManager` Return information about attached displays;
  * `gopi.SPI` Send and receive data on the SPI bus;
  * `gopi.I2C` Send and receive data on the I2C bus;
  * `gopi.GPIO` Interact with the GPIO connector and watch for changes of state;
  * `gopi.LIRC` Receive IR codes from remote controls;
  * `gopi.LIRCKeycodeManager` Map IR codes to keycodes.

These are examples you can look at which demonstate the features:

  * (`hw`)[https://github.com/djthorpe/gopi/tree/master/cmd/hw] provides commands for enquiring about
    the hardware platform and devices.
