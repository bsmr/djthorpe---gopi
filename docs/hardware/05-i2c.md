# I²C interface

I²C is a serial protocol for two-wire interface to connect low-speed devices like sensors, A/D and D/A converters and other similar peripherals in embedded systems. It was invented by Philips and now it is used by almost all major IC manufacturers. For more information see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C).

The I²C unit allows you to read and write data with daisy-chained peripherals, each of which should have a unique address.

{% hint style="info" %}
| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Name | `gopi/i2c` |
| Interface | `gopi.I2C` |
| Type | `gopi.UNIT_I2C` |
| Import | `github.com/djthorpe/gopi/v2/unit/i2c` |
| Compatibility | Linux |
{% endhint %}

The unit adheres to the following interface:

```go
type gopi.I2C interface {
    gopi.Unit

    SetSlave(uint8) error
    GetSlave() uint8
    DetectSlave(uint8) (bool, error)

    // Read 
    ReadUint8(reg uint8) (uint8, error)
    ReadInt8(reg uint8) (int8, error)
    ReadUint16(reg uint8) (uint16, error)
    ReadInt16(reg uint8) (int16, error)
    ReadBlock(reg, length uint8) ([]byte, error)

    // Write
    WriteUint8(reg, value uint8) error
    WriteInt8(reg uint8, value int8) error
    WriteUint16(reg uint8, value uint16) error
    WriteInt16(reg uint8, value int16) error
}
```

You need to set a slave address when using the tool, which is a value between `0x00` and `0x7F`. You can use the `DetectSlave` method which returns `true` if a peripheral was found at a particular slave address. For example,

```go
func Main(app gopi.App, args []string) error {
    i2c := app.I2C()
    slave := app.Flags().GetUint("slave",gopi.FLAG_NS_DEFAULT)
    if detected, err := i2c.DetectSlave(slave); detected == false {
        return fmt.Errorf("No peripheral detected")
    } else if err := this.i2c.SetSlave(slave); err != nil {
        return err
    } else if reg0, err := this.i2c.ReadInt16(0) {
        fmt.Println("REG0=",reg0)        
    }
    // ...
}
```

The unit adds an additional commmand line flag of `-i2c.bus` to select which interface to attach to. On the Raspberry Pi, you need to enable the interface using the `raspi-config` command and ensure your user has the correct permissions to access the device using the following command:

```bash
bash% sudo usermod -a -G i2c ${USER}
```

There's more information about enabling it [here](https://www.electronicwings.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-i2c).

There are some examples of using the I2C unit in the [sensors](https://github.com/djthorpe/gopi/tree/74fc940b06eb9b4fb39545123a319bc8eeb21710/docs/github.com/djthorpe/sensors/README.md) repository including temperature, light and humidity measurement using I²C peripherals.
