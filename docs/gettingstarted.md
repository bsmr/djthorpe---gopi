# Getting Started

In order to get started, build some of the examples in the "cmd" folder. They
can be built with the makefile.

  * `make` will run the tests and install the examples
  * `make test` will run the test suite
  * `make install` will build and install the examples without testing
  * `make clean` will remove intermediate files

There are two examples in this repository you can examine in order so you can
develop your own applications:

  * `helloworld` demonstrates the most canonical code, taking in command-line
    arguments, outputting a message and waiting for user input to end the
    program;
  * `timers` demonstrates the use of the timer module, either outputting a
    single message, or one on a repeating basis.

Fuller documentation of the examples and developing your own code against this 
framework is available in the documentation.
