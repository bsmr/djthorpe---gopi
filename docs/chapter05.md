# Application Examples

There are a number of example applications in the `cmd` folder which you can examine and run. The following sections describe how to install and run these examples. Ultimately you can compile them all through the use of the `make` command:

* [cmd/helloworld](https://github.com/djthorpe/gopi/tree/v2/cmd/helloworld) is the canonical first program. It prints out your name and waits for you to send keyboard interrupt \(CTRL+C\);
* [cmd/timers](https://github.com/djthorpe/gopi/tree/v2/cmd/timers) prints out messages as a ticker fires once every second;
* [cmd/hwinfo](https://github.com/djthorpe/gopi/tree/v2/cmd/hwinfo) displays a table of hardware information about your platform;
* [cmd/i2cdetect](https://github.com/djthorpe/gopi/tree/v2/cmd/i2cdetect) displays a table of detected I2C devices connected on a bus;
* [cmd/fonts](https://github.com/djthorpe/gopi/tree/v2/cmd/fonts) loads fonts from a path and displays information about the loaded fonts;
* [cmd/discovery](https://github.com/djthorpe/gopi/tree/v2/cmd/discovery) displays service names and instances registered through multicast DNS \(mDNS\) on your local network;
