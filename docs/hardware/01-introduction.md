# Introduction

In this section I describe how to interact with your hardware platform, including:

* Getting information about your hardware, including graphical display;
* Interacting with the General Purpose Input-Output \(GPIO\) interface;
* The IÂ²C interface;
* The SPI interface;
* The LIRC \(Linux Infrared Remote Control\) interface.

All of these features are available on the Raspberry Pi but not necessarily on other platforms yet. You will use these hardware units to develop sensors and actuator drivers, or simply interact with external hardware.
