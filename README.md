This repository contains an application framework for the Go language, which
will allow you to develop applications which utilize a number of features
of your computer. It's targetted at the Raspberry Pi presently. The following
features are intended to be supported:

  * The GPIO, I2C and SPI interfaces
  * Display and display surfaces, bitmaps and vector graphics
  * GPU acceleration for 2D graphics
  * Font loading and rendering in bitmap and vector forms
  * Input devices like the mouse, keyboard and touchscreen
  * Infrared transmission and receiving, for example for remote controls
  * Network microservices, announcement and discovery

It would also be great to support the following features in the future:

  * Image and video encoding/decoding, including utilizing hardware
    acceleration
  * Connected cameras
  * 3D graphics
  * Audio devices
  * User interface widgets and layout
  * Building for Darwin (Macintosh) targets
