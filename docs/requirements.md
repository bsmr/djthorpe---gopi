The tested requirements are currently:

  * Any Raspberry Pi (v2, v3, Zero and Zero W have been tested)
  * Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (other distributions may work, but not tested)
  * Go 1.12

In order to use the library, you'll need to have a working version of Go on 
your Raspberry Pi, which you can [download](https://golang.org/dl/). Then 
retrieve the library on your device, using:

```sh
go get github.com/djthorpe/gopi/v2
```
